    <h3>A quick, healthy, and delicious breakfast</h3>
    <p>
        Ever feel the need to deprive yourself of the basic joys of a decent breakfast because you're in a hurry to go to work
        and be taken advantage of by a boss who doesn't appreciate or value you and pockets 99% of the value that you create?
    </p>
    <p>
        If so, then we have the perfect solution for you! We've got peanut butter, on a piece of bread. And then some sliced bananas on top.
        You could also add honey if you want but that's a little bit expensive isn't it?
