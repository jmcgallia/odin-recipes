        <h3>A delicious breakfast delight made of oats and topped with brown sugar</h3>
        <p>
            My momma used to make this recipes during the dark dark nights of the first clone war. I remember feeling
            comfort despite the faint blaster fire heard in the distance when consuming this masterpiece.

            Basically, you just put the oats in a pot with some water and let them absorb some water for 10 minutes or something.
            Then you turn on the heat until the water is at a boil and let the oats cook until they are a consistency that you like.
            Then you put it in a bowl and put whatever you want on top like some fruit or brown sugar, and pray the clones don't make it
            to your home.
